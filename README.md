Salesforce CRM Data Extractor

This is a chrome extension for extracting Salesforce CRM data
using DOM scraping.

How it works:
- Content script detects object type from URL
- Extract basic info from page
- Store in chrome.storage.local
- Popup shows stored data

No API usage, only DOM based extraction.
